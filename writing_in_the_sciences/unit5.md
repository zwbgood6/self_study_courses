# Unit5

## order of writing

tables and figures -> results -> methods -> introduction -> discussion -> abstract

editors, reviewers, and readers may look first at **titles, abstracts, and tables and figures!**

## tables and figures

- figures and tables should stand alone and tell a complete story. Reader should not need to refer back to the main text

>> - use **table footnote** to explain/define aronyms and experimental details in figures and tables, if possible

>>>> table footnote is just below the table, not at the end of each page

- table title

>> - use the same key terms in the table and the text

>> - keep title and heading brief

- table format

>> - three lines are enough. DO NOT use grid lines!

>> - add unit for variables

>> - words should be aligned in the table. Be professional!

- Figure legend

>> - may contain: 1) brief title, 2) essential experimental details, 3) definitions of symbol/line/bar patterns
>>>> 4) explanation of panels (A,B,C,D) 5) statistical information (if possible)

- graphs

>> - line graphs: show trends over time, age, or dose

>> - bar graphs: compare groups at one time point

>> - shpw relationships between two variables

>>>> see individual data points=more information

>> - **if the data are complicated, use table to represent them**

## results

- results != raw data

- result section should

>> - **summarize** what **the data** show

>>>> point out simple relationships

>>>> describe big-picture trends

>>>> cite figures or tables that present supporting data

>> - **avoid** simple **repeating the numbers** that are already available in tables and figures

- verb tense

>> - use past tense for completed actions:

```
e.g.

We found that...

The average reaction time was...

Men smoked more cigarettes than...
```

>> - use present tense for assertions that continue to be true (data/figure/table shows...)

```
e.g.

Figure 1 shows...

The findings confirm...

The data suggest...

We believe that this shows...
```

- use active voice

>> - we found

>> - we compared

```

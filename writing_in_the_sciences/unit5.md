# Unit5

## order of writing

tables and figures -> results -> methods -> introduction -> discussion -> abstract

editors, reviewers, and readers may look first at **titles, abstracts, and tables and figures!**

## tables and figures

- figures and tables should stand alone and tell a complete story. Reader should not need to refer back to the main text

>> - use **table footnote** to explain/define aronyms and experimental details in figures and tables, if possible

>>>> table footnote is just below the table, not at the end of each page

- table title

>> - use the same key terms in the table and the text

>> - keep title and heading brief

- table format

>> - three lines are enough. DO NOT use grid lines!

>> - add unit for variables

>> - words should be aligned in the table. Be professional!

- Figure legend

>> - may contain: 1) brief title, 2) essential experimental details, 3) definitions of symbol/line/bar patterns
>>>> 4) explanation of panels (A,B,C,D) 5) statistical information (if possible)

- graphs

>> - line graphs: show trends over time, age, or dose

>> - bar graphs: compare groups at one time point

>> - shpw relationships between two variables

>>>> see individual data points=more information

>> - **if the data are complicated, use table to represent them**

## results

- results != raw data

- result section should

>> - **summarize** what **the data** show

>>>> point out simple relationships

>>>> describe big-picture trends

>>>> cite figures or tables that present supporting data

>> - **avoid** simple **repeating the numbers** that are already available in tables and figures

- verb tense

>> - use past tense for completed actions:

```
e.g.

We found that...

The average reaction time was...

Men smoked more cigarettes than...
```

>> - use present tense for assertions that continue to be true (data/figure/table shows...)

```
e.g.

Figure 1 shows...

The findings confirm...

The data suggest...

We believe that this shows...
```

- use active voice

>> - we found

>> - we compared

## methods 

- give a clear **overview** of what was done

- give **enough information** to replicate the study

- be complete

>> - break into small sections with subheadings

>> - cite a reference for commonly used methods 
```
>>>> e.g. as previously described [1]
```
>> - display in a flow diagram or table

- we may use **jargon** and the **passive voice** more liberally in method section

- verb tense

>> - report methods in past tense 

>>>> we measured/analyzed/found

>> - use present tense to describe how data are presented in the paper

>>>> data are summarized as means +/- SD

## introduction

 - follows a fairly standard format
 
 - typically 3 paragraphs long (range 2-5)
 
 - should focus on the specific hypothesis/aim of your study
 
 - diagram
 
 ***paragraph 1
 
 >> - background (what's known)
 
 ***paragraph 2
 
 >> - knowledge gap (what's unknown, limitations and gaps in previous studies)
 
 ***paragraph 3
 
 >> - hypothesis, question, purpose statement
 
 >>>> we hypothesized/aimed
 
 >> - approach, plan of attack, proposed solution
 
 >>>> our study is going to fill in the gaps and limitations of previous studies (but no reuslts or implications here)
 
 >> - summarize at a high level. Leave detailed descriptions, speculations, and criticisms of particular studies for discussion
 
 - tips
 
 >> - keep paragraphs short
 
 >> - write for a general audience (clear, concise, non-technical)
 
 >> - known -> unknown -> questions/hypothesis (general -> specific)
 
 ## discussion
 
 - diagram
 
 >> - answer the question asked
 
 >> - support your conclusion (your data, others' data)
 
 >> - defend your conclusion (anticipate criticisms)
 
 >> - give the "big-pictures" take-home messsage
 
 >>>> (**VIP**: what do my results mean and why should anyone care?)
 
 - **organization**
 
 >> - key finding (answer to the question(s) asked in Intro.)
 
 >>>> Start with: "WE FOUND THAT..." (or something similar)
 
 >>>> Explain what the data mean (big-picture!) 
 
 >>>> State if he findings are novel
 
 >> - key secondary findings
 
 >> - Context
 
 >>>> give possible mechanisms or pathways
 
 >>>> compare your results with other people's results
 
 >>>> discuss how your findings support or challenge the paradigm
 
 >> - Strengths and limitations
 
 >>>> anticipate readers' questions/criticisms
 
 >>>> explain why your results are robust
 
 >> - What's next
 
 >>>> recommended confirmatory studies ("needs to be confirmed")
 
 >>>> point our unanswered questions and future directions
 
 >> - The "so what?": impplicate, speculate, recommend
 
 >>>> give big-picture implications of findings
 
 >>>> tell readers why they should care
  
 >> - Strong conclusion
 
 >>>> restate main findings
 
 >>>> give a final take-home message

- tips

>> - active voice/tell it like a story

>> - start and end with the main finding

>> - focus on what your data do prove, not what you had hoped your data would prove

>> - write out the limitations and **focus on the limitations that matter**, do not write generic limitations

>>>> **anticipate** what the reader **may criticize**

>> - make sure your take-home message is clear and consistent

- verb tense

>> - past tense (refer to study details, results, analyses, and background research)

>>>> We *found* that

>>>> Subjects *may have experienced

>>>> Miller et al. *found

>> - present tense (when talking about what the data suggest)

>>>> The greater weight loss *suggests

>>>> The explanation for this difference *is* not clear

>>>> Potential explanations *include

## abstract

- abstract (ab=out, trahere=pull; "to pull out")

>> - overview of the main story

>> - gives highlights from each section of the paper

>> -  limited length (100-300 words)

-organization

>> - background

>> - question/aim/hypothesis

>>>> "we asked whether", "we hypothesized that"

>> - experiment(s)

>>>> quick summary of key materials and methods

>> - results

>>>> key results found

>> - conclusion

>>>> the answer to the question asked before

>> - implication, speculation, or recommendation

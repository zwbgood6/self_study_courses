# Unit5

## order if writing

tables and figures -> results -> methods -> introduction -> discussion -> abstract

editors, reviewers, and readers may look first at **titles, abstracts, and tables and figures!**

## tables and figures

- figures and tables should stand alone and tell a complete story. Reader should not need to refer back to the main text

>> - use **table footnote** to explain/define aronyms and experimental details in figures and tables, if possible

>>>> table footnote is just below the table, not at the end of each page

- table title

>> - use the same key terms in the table and the text

>> - keep title and heading brief

- table format

>> - three lines are enough. DO NOT use grid lines!

>> - add unit for variables

>> - words should be aligned in the table. Be professional!

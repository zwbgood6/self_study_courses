## experiment with punctuation

dash, colon, semicolon, parenthesis - use it to vary sentence structure

increasing power to seperate: 
comma -> colon -> dash -> parentheses -> semicolon -> period

- semicolon

>> - it is used to link two independent sentences

semicolon can give enough attention to the second sentences, compared with comma;
semicolon can connect two sentences, compared with period.

```
e.g. 
Kennedy could be a cold and vain man, and he led a life of privilege. 
But he knew something about the world; he also cared about it.
```

separate items in lists that contain internal punctuation (e.g. comma)

- parentheses

insert a word, phrase, or sentence into a passage 

if removing the material within the parentheses, the main point of the sentence should not change

parentheses give the reader permission to skip over the material

- colon

explanation: the sencond sentence explains the first or 

amplification: the second sentence amplifies the first sentence

Some editors capitalize the first letter of the second sentences

e.g. A is very beatiful: She has long hairs and big blue eyes. (semicolon use lower case)

use nouns after the colon

- dash

use it to add more information


## practice, colon and dash

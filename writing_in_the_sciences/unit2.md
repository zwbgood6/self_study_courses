## 2.1 Use the active voices

- active voice: subject (agent) + verb + noun (receipient)

- advantages of the active voice 

>> emphasize the author's respobsibility: involve human in the sentence

>> increase readability

>> reduce ambiguity

- **When to use passive voice:**

>> **Method** section of paper: what is done, because we have to *avoid using **we*** for many sentences.

>> **introduction, result, discussion** sections use active voice

## 2.2 Is it OK to use *WE* and *I* in the paper?

YES

## 2.3 Active voice practice

## 2.4 Write with verbs 

- Use strong verbs

>> obtain estimates of -> estimate

>> has seen an expansion in -> has expanded

>> provides a methodologic emphasis -> emphsize

>> take an assessment of -> assess

>> provide a review of -> review

>> offer confirmation of -> confirm

>> make a decision -> decide

>> shows a peak -> peak

>> provide a description of -> describe

>> report approximately -> estimate

>> estimate -> project 

- Replace "to be" verbs

>> Do not write too many (is, are, am, was, were) in the passage

- Don't turn verbs into nouns: who does what to whom

- Don't bury the main verb

>> keep the subject and main verb close!!

## 2.5 practice examples

## 2.6 Tips on grammar related to scientific writing

- data is plural, datum is singular

>> The data show/support/are ...

- affect and effect

>> affect: verb form of influence 

>> effect: noun form of influence

- compare to and compare with

>> compare to -> point our similarities between two different things

>> compare with -> point out differences between similar things (in science, we usually use this)

- That and which

>> The bike that is broken is in the garage. (Identifies which bike of many)

>> The bike, which is broken, is in the garage. (Adds a fact about the only bike in question)

- singular antecedents

e.g. 

>> Each student worries about (their) grade. -> wrong

>> Each student worries about (her/his) grade. -> correct

>> All students worry about their grades. -> correct and better

## 2.1 Use the active voices

active voice: subject (agent) + verb + noun (receipient)

advantages of the active voice

When to use pasisve voice:

**Method** section of paper: what is done,because we have to *avoid using **we*** for many sentences.

**introduction, result, discussion** sections use active voice

## 2.2 Is it OK to use *WE* and *I* in the paper?

YES

## 2.3

## 2.4 use strong verbs

- Pick the right verb:

report approximately -> estimate

estimate -> project 

- Replace "to be" verbs

- Don't turn verbs into nouns: who does what to whom

- Don't bury the main verb: keep the subject and main verb close

## prewriting step

- gather and organize information **BEFORE** writing the first draft

>> - insert pictures and bibtex into latex

- build the roadmap

>> - think about hwo to formalize **introduction**, 

>> - what works should be included in **previous work**, 

>> - what **technical details** I should mention

- compositional organization

>> - similar ideas should be grouped in one paragraph

## the writing step

- Tips for the first draft

>> - the goal is to get the ideas down in order

>> - focus on logical organization more than sentence-level details

## revision

- read it out loud

- **do a verb check**

>> - **step 1**: take a paragraph and underline the main verb of each sentence

>> - **step 2**: check "to be" verbs, passive verbs, and buried verbs (noun is far away from verb)

>> - **step 3**: watch for: jargon, acronyms, repetitive words, adverbs 

>>>> (very, really, quite, basically; for other adverbs, we can also change them in other format)

- **do an organizational review**

>> - **step 1**: sums up the main point of each paragraph in each section

>> - **step 2**: move paragraph around to improve logical flow 

>> - **step 3**: bring similar ideas together

- **get outside feedback**

>> - ask them **the main findings**, **take-home messages**, **significance of your work**

>> - ask them **hard-to-read sections/paragraphs/sentences**

## checklist for the final draft

- numerical consistency 

>> - e.g. the numbers mentioned in the paragraph and in the table should be consistent 

- citation

>> - cite the original/primary source

>> - what you cite should be in the orignal paper (cite with nowhere may happen!!)

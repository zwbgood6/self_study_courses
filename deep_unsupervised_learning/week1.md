# Deep unsupervised learning

Definition: Capturing rich patterns in raw data with deep networks in a **label-free** way

e.g.

1. generative models: recreate raw data distribution

2. self-supervised learning: fully use unlabelled data and train the model in a supervised way

Application:

1. Generated images (super resolution)/videos/text/audio/math/text

2. Compression - lossless/lossy

3. Downstream tasks - sentiment detection, NLP, Vision

Good point: Train the model in an unsupervised way. After that, use labelled data to train it in the supervised way or use RL methods.
